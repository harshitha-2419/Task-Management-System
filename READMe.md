# Task Management System

This is a simple web-based task management system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and manage tasks with deadlines. The application uses localStorage for persistent data storage and provides reminders for approaching deadlines.

## Features

- Add tasks with title, description, and due date.
- Edit and delete existing tasks.
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
- Filter tasks by status: all, complete, or incomplete.
- Persistent storage using browser localStorage.
- Reminder flash messages for tasks due today or tomorrow.
- Responsive and clean user interface.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Use the form to add new tasks with a title, description, and due date.
3. Tasks will be displayed in a list, sorted by due date.
4. Use the "Mark Complete" button to toggle task completion status.
5. Use the filter dropdown to view all, complete, or incomplete tasks.
6. Reminders will appear as flash messages for tasks due today or tomorrow.

## Technical Details

- The application uses vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and event handling.
- Tasks are stored in `localStorage` to persist data across sessions.
- Flash messages are shown with smooth animations and prevent overlapping.
- The UI is styled with CSS, including responsive design for smaller screens.

## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication and multi-user support.
- Implement task assignment to different users.
- Add task priority and categorization.
- Enhance reminder notifications with email or push notifications.
